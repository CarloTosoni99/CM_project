% This method is used to generate the direct graph G = (N, A). this graph
% is used to outline the matrix E, which is edge-node adjacency matrix of
% G. The function requires only the number of nodes of the direct graph and
% the number of edges, then the direct graph is randomly generated

function G = graph_initialization(n, e)

% n is the number of nodes of the graph, while e is the number of edges
